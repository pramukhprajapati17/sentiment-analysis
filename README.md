# Sentiment-analysis
sentiment analysis on restaurant reviews
Overview
This project involves analyzing restaurant reviews using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning techniques to classify customer reviews as positive or negative. The analysis provides insights into customer sentiments and helps restaurants improve their services and customer experience.

# Features
Sentiment Classification: Classifies reviews as positive or negative.
Word Cloud Visualizations: Generates word clouds for positive and negative reviews.
Feature Extraction: Uses CountVectorizer to identify the most frequently used words in reviews.
Naive Bayes Model: Classifies sentiments based on extracted features.
Insights and Data: Extracts meaningful information to improve customer experience management.
Libraries & Tools
Platform: Google Colab (for running the code)
Libraries:
pandas: Data manipulation and reading datasets
nltk: Text preprocessing (removing stopwords, stemming)
scikit-learn: Machine learning model development (Naive Bayes classifier, CountVectorizer)
matplotlib: Visualizing data insights
wordcloud: Generating word clouds
numpy: Handling numerical operations
# Methodology
Data Preprocessing:

Removing stopwords and stemming text using NLTK.
Feature Extraction:

Using CountVectorizer to convert text data into numerical form based on word frequency.
Model Training:

Training a Naive Bayes classifier to classify sentiment (positive or negative) based on the features extracted.
Model Evaluation:

Evaluating the performance of the classifier and displaying results using confusion matrices.
Visualization:

Generating word clouds to visualize the most frequent words in positive and negative reviews.
Creating a bar chart to show the frequency of top words based on CountVectorizer output.

# Installation
Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/your-username/restaurant-sentiment-analysis.git

Install the required libraries:
pip install pandas nltk scikit-learn matplotlib wordcloud numpy
Open the notebook (Sentiment.ipynb) in Google Colab to run the code.

# Usage
Data Input:

Input restaurant reviews (text data) into the system.
Run the Code:

Execute the notebook to preprocess, extract features, and train the model.
View Results:

View sentiment predictions, visualizations (word clouds), and insights from the reviews.
Output
Predicted Sentiment: Each review will be classified as either positive or negative.
Word Clouds: Visual representations of frequently occurring words in positive and negative reviews.
Insights: A bar chart of top features influencing sentiment classification.
Example
Here's an example of how the word cloud looks for positive and negative reviews:


# Conclusion
This project offers a robust solution for analyzing customer sentiment in restaurant reviews. By utilizing NLP and machine learning, it helps businesses gain actionable insights to enhance customer experiences. The visual tools make it easier for users to understand trends and identify areas of improvement.

Future Enhancements
Implement multi-class sentiment classification (positive, neutral, negative).
Use deep learning models like LSTM or BERT for improved accuracy.
Add support for multilingual review analysis.
